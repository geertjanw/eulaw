No,  they  did  not  disregard  and  disrespect  the  Court  -  the  ‘punchline’  is  that  the  second tobacco advertising directive contains a much more limited prohibition on tobacco advertising than the first directive.  

As is clear from Article 3(1) of the second directive the prohibition is now limited to advertising in the press and other printed publications (with some exceptions), whereas  the  first  directive  contained  a  very  general  prohibition  on  tobacco  advertising covering  for  example  advertising  on  posters,  parasols,  ashtrays  and  other  articles  used  in hotels, restaurants and cafés, and the prohibition of advertising spots in cinemas – these types of  prohibitions  “in  no  way  help  to  facilitate  trade  in  the  products  concerned”  (Tobacco Advertising judgment, para. 99).

In fact, the Court already hinted to this possibility in its judgment: “In principle, therefore, a Directive  prohibiting  the  advertising  of  tobacco  products  in  periodicals,  magazines  and newspapers  could  be  adopted  on  the  basis  of  Article  100a  of  the  Treaty  [now  Article  114 TFEU]   with   a   view   to   ensuring   the   free   movement   of   press   products...”   (Tobacco Advertising judgment, para. 98).
