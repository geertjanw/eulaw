## Abuse of Dominant Position

### United Brands

The Court ruled that both the relevant product market and the relevant geographical market must be determined before anything can be said about an undertakingâ€™s dominant position. 

In order to  determine the relevant product market, one has to ask whether the product in question is reasonably interchangeable by consumers for other products. In this case: are bananas an integral part of the (broader) fresh fruit market or does the relevant product market consist of the bananas market only? The Court concluded the latter because bananas have certain characteristics, appearance, taste, softness, seedlessness, easy handling, and a constant level of production which enable it to satisfy the constant needs of an important  section of the population consisting of the very young, the old and the sick. They cannot simply replace soft to bite bananas by hard to bite apples.

The second type of market is defined as the geographic area in which the product is marketed and where the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous for the effect of the economic power of the undertaking concerned to be able to be evaluated. In this case the Court agreed with the Commission that the relevant  geographical market consisted of a substantial part of the common market.

### Hofer and Elser

A public employment agency engaged in the business of employment procurement may be classified as an undertaking for the purpose of applying the Community competition rules since, in the context of competition law, that classification applies to every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed.

## State Aid

### Altmark

According to the landmark Altmark judgment, compensation for a public service obligation does not constitute state aid, provided that four cumulative criteria are met. Firstly, there must be a clear public service obligation. Secondly, prior to entrustment objective and transparent criteria must be determined to calculate the costs that must cover the compensation. Thirdly, the compensation may not exceed the total net cost incurred by the SGEI provider, including a reasonable profit. The fourth criterion requires that a public service provider is selected pursuant to a public tender or must be compensated based on the analysis on the costs a well-run, average undertaking would incur.
