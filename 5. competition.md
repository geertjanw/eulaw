## Abuse of Dominant Position

### United Brands

The Court ruled that both the relevant product market and the relevant geographical market must be determined before anything can be said about an undertakingâ€™s dominant position. 

In order to  determine the relevant product market, one has to ask whether the product in question is reasonably interchangeable by consumers for other products. In this case: are bananas an integral part of the (broader) fresh fruit market or does the relevant product market consist of the bananas market only? The Court concluded the latter because bananas have certain characteristics, appearance, taste, softness, seedlessness, easy handling, and a constant level of production which enable it to satisfy the constant needs of an important  section of the population consisting of the very young, the old and the sick. They cannot simply replace soft to bite bananas by hard to bite apples.

The second type of market is defined as the geographic area in which the product is marketed and where the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous for the effect of the economic power of the undertaking concerned to be able to be evaluated. In this case the Court agreed with the Commission that the relevant  geographical market consisted of a substantial part of the common market.

### Hofer and Elser

A public employment agency engaged in the business of employment procurement may be classified as an undertaking for the purpose of applying the Community competition rules since, in the context of competition law, that classification applies to every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed.
